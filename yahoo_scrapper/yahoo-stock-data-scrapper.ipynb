       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning upgraded MacBook Pro laptops this year with much faster processors, updated displays and the return of its magnetic charger, according to a person with knowledge of the plans.The new laptops are planned to come in two screen sizes, a 14-inch model codenamed J314 and a 16-inch version internally dubbed J316. Both will use next-generation versions of Apple’s in-house Mac processors, upgraded with more cores and enhanced graphics, the person said, asking not to be named as the products are not yet announced.These devices will mark Apple’s first high-end laptops to move away from Intel Corp. components. The company updated its base 13-inch MacBook Pro with its own M1 chip in November, to broadly positive reviews.Beyond the more powerful chips, Apple is also planning to step up the displays in its new MacBook Pros with brighter, higher-contrast panels, the person said. The new Macs will look similar to the current versions, albeit with minor design changes. Apple is aiming to launch the new MacBook Pros around the middle of the year.An Apple spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Over the past five years, Apple has relied on USB-C ports for both power and data transfer on its laptops, making them compatible with other manufacturers’ chargers. But the company is now bringing back MagSafe, the magnetic power adapter that means any accidental yanking of the power cable would simply detach it from the laptop rather than pull down the entire computer. It was a favorite feature of the company’s portable PC lineup that was first introduced in 2006 and most recently revived for its latest lineup of iPhones.The return of MagSafe with the next MacBook Pros will also allow those laptops to charge at a faster rate, the person said. The connector will be similar to the elongated pill-shape design of the older MagSafe port.Despite moving away from USB-C for charging, Apple will still include multiple USB-C ports on its future Macs.Read more: Apple Plans First iMac Desktop Redesign in Nearly a DecadeIn developing its next set of Mac laptops, Apple has also tested versions that remove the Touch Bar from its laptop keyboards. The Touch Bar, introduced as part of the last MacBook Pro redesign in 2016, turns the keyboard’s top row from function keys into a touchscreen strip that can display a variety of information and a changing set of controls to adapt to apps and tasks. Some professional users have said they found that control scheme less convenient than physical keys.Apple is also planning a redesigned MacBook Air, but that is not expected to be released until long after the next MacBook Pros.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Chipmaking Tool Supplier Expects Demand Boom to Last Years',\n",
       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- The global shortage for chips that’s shut down factory lines and fueled waiting lists for the hottest consumer electronics is showing no signs of abating and that’s good news for specialist suppliers like Tokyo Electron Ltd.The provider of semiconductor fabrication tools expects orders from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to rise for years to come as those companies scale up their production to sate booming demand.“Demand is overwhelming as the supply of various components is going to tighten toward this year’s end and more investment to increase manufacturing capacity is likely,” Chief Executive Officer Toshiki Kawai said in an interview with Bloomberg News. His remarks came ahead of TSMC announcing it’s raised its capital expenditure to more than $25 billion this year, helping push up Tokyo Electron’s share price by as much as 5.7% on Friday to a record high.TSMC and Samsung are the leaders in adopting extreme ultraviolet lithography, the most advanced fabrication method that lets them reach smaller geometries like 5nm today and 3nm in 2022, unlocking more powerful and efficient chips. Tokyo Electron commands 100% of the business for photoresist coaters and developers used in factories deploying EUV technology, according to its CEO, so every new EUV machine that goes online adds to its bottom line.“I can confidently say there’s no cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturer in the world that has no Tokyo Electron machineries in their lines,” Kawai said. “More factory investment means more business for us.”Read more: Carmakers Crying Out for Chips Fuels Growth for GlobalfoundriesThe automotive industry, which had been among the hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, is showing signs of recovery, which have translated into a widespread chip shortage as smartphone makers like Apple Inc. and Samsung’s consumer division were already raising their orders. More advanced phones with 5G wireless technology require even more silicon, and capacitor supplier Murata Manufacturing Co. anticipates 500 million of those devices in the coming fiscal year.Read more: Apple Supplier Murata Expects Half Billion 5G Phones in New YearIntel Corp., the longtime leader in silicon technology, has also been in talks with TSMC and Samsung about outsourcing some of its business, adding to the urgency of investment and capacity expansion. Samsung has committed in excess of $100 billion over a decade to develop its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and keep up with its Taiwanese rival.Kazuyoshi Saito, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities, said Tokyo Electron’s tools for EUV lines require extremely precise manufacturing to shut out any dust, making these EUV-compatible machines expensive.“More adoption of the EUV technology benefits Tokyo Electron in terms of volumes and unit prices,” he said.Tokyo Electron’s Kawai said demand for the company’s products has long been on the rise due to an expected boom of 5G smartphones and autonomous driving, but the Covid-19 pandemic ignited demand elsewhere, including logistics, retail and drug discovery.“Our industry has become essential to people’s lives because all industries that serve those needs now require semiconductor chips to advance,” he said.SEMI, a U.S.-based industry association, estimated global sales of semiconductor equipment to have grown 16% in 2020 from a year ago to a record $68.9 billion and the figure is expected to rise again to $71.9 billion this year. Tokyo Electron projects its revenue will hit 2 trillion yen ($19.3 billion) in the fiscal year ending in March 2024 from 1.13 trillion yen in the year ended in March 2020.One possible disruption to Tokyo Electron’s momentum could come from ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, with several Chinese companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. now subject to sanctions and bans. Kawai said customers in China are as important as those in other regions, though his company will adhere to rules and restrictions set by the U.S. government.“We won’t provide our products to customers that the U.S. manufacturers can’t, because that would be a risk for us if we do,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'title': 'TSMC’s $28 Billion Spending Blitz Ignites a Global Chip Rally',\n",
       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. triggered a global chip stock rally after outlining plans to pour as much as $28 billion into capital spending this year, a staggering sum aimed at expanding its technological lead and constructing a plant in Arizona to serve key American customers.The envisioned spending spree sent chipmaking gear manufacturers surging from New York to Tokyo. Capital spending for 2021 is targeted at $25 billion to $28 billion, compared with $17.2 billion the previous year. About 80% of the outlay will be devoted to advanced processor technologies, suggesting TSMC anticipates a surge in business for cutting-edge chipmaking. Analysts expect Intel Corp., the world’s best-known chipmaker, to outsource manufacture to the likes of TSMC after a series of inhouse technology slip-ups.The sheer scale of TSMC’s envisioned budget -- more than half its projected revenue for the year -- underscores TSMC’s determination to maintain its dominance and supply its biggest American clients from Apple Inc. to Qualcomm Inc. At 52% of projected 2021 revenue, the chipmaker’s planned spending would be the sixth-highest among all companies with a value of more than $10 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The outlay may also ramp up pressure on Intel, whose budget for 2020 was roughly $14.5 billion.“The high capex guide is indicative of TSMC’s confidence in Intel’s outsourcing business,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “TSMC’s track record also shows high capex always subsequently led to high growth.”The world’s largest contract chipmaker expects revenue of $12.7 billion to $13 billion this quarter, ahead of the $12.4 billion average of analyst estimates. That will power mid-teens sales growth this year, though that’s roughly half the pace of the increase in 2020.Net income in the quarter ended December climbed 23% to NT$142.8 billion ($5.1 billion), compared with the NT$137.2 billion average of analyst estimates, the chipmaker said Thursday. That contributed to a 50% increase in full-year profit, the speediest rate of expansion since 2010. Sales in the December quarter climbed 14% to a record NT$361.5 billion, according to previously disclosed monthly numbers, helped in part by robust demand for Apple’s new 5G iPhones.Read more: As Chip Rivals Struggle, TSMC Goes In for the Kill: Tim CulpanTSMC jumped as much as 5.6%, the most since July, to an all-time high in early Friday trade, extending a rally of more than 70% over the past year. Supplier Tokyo Electron Ltd. climbed more than 4%, while ASML Holding NV rose 5.9% on Thursday. Other semiconductor companies in the U.S. rallied on Thursday, with Applied Materials Inc. gaining almost 8% and Lam Research Corp up 6% in New York. Intel gained 4%.The fourth-quarter results revealed increasing contributions from TSMC’s most-advanced 5-nanometer process technology -- used to make Apple’s A14 chips. That accounted for about 20% of total revenue during the quarter, more than doubling its share from the previous three months, while 7nm represented 29%. By business segment, TSMC’s smartphone business contributed about 51% to revenue, while high-performance computing (HPC) was at 31%.As rivals like United Microelectronics Corp. fall behind and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. struggles with American sanctions, TSMC’s pivotal role is likely to expand in 2021. The company has been racing to meet demand from larger-volume electronics clients, exacerbating a severe shortage of automotive chips that’s forcing firms like Honda Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to curtail production.TSMC said the automotive industry had been “soft” since 2018 and demand only started to recover in the fourth quarter. The company is working with its automotive customers to address the capacity supply issues, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said, though he didn’t elaborate when the bottlenecks that forced carmakers to cut production could be resolved.Read more: Missing Chips Snarl Car Production at Factories WorldwideExecutives didn’t address reports about potential orders from Intel on Thursday, saying that they don’t discuss specific customers. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker held talks with TSMC about making some of its best chips, people familiar have said, though it’s unclear whether the company may pivot after the appointment of Pat Gelsinger as its new CEO.“We believe Intel would not change its plans of CPU foundry outsourcing even with the CEO change,” Citigroup analysts wrote in a note, citing the time and costs associated with process qualification as well as the risk that U.S. chipmaker won’t get capacity from TSMC if it doesn’t book ahead. “In our view, Intel will be one of the major customers to first adopt 3nm for production. TSMC might start shipping 3nm wafers to Intel from early 3Q22.”Read more: Intel Talks With TSMC, Samsung to Outsource Some Chip ProductionConstruction on a planned $12 billion plant in the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona will begin this year, executives reiterated, without specifying how much of the planned budget for this year will be allocated to the project. The factory will be completed by 2024, with initial target output of 20,000 wafers per month, though the company envisions having a “mega scale production site” over the long term, Chairman Mark Liu said.Even as TSMC grows, foundries such as TSMC, UMC and Globalfoundries Inc. aren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also Xboxes and PlayStations and even certain iPhones. TSMC is by far the most advanced of the foundries responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors, serving the likes of Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors NV, which also supply the mobile and auto industries.What Bloomberg Industries Says:TSMC’s $28 billion capital investment target for 2021 is 50% more than investors expected, and amounts to management’s strong vote of confidence in demand for smartphones and high-performance computing (HPC) chips over the next three years. The capital outlay target implies 2021 sales could leap to $56 billion, 4% higher than the $54 billion consensus expects, assuming 50% capital spending intensity.&#92;-- Charles Shum, analystClick here for the research(Adds analyst comments in fifth and 12th paragraph, latest share performance in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc. widened its dispute with Apple Inc. over access to its popular Fortnite video game as it submitted a complaint to the U.K.’s antitrust tribunal.The company said Apple’s decision to remove the game from the iPhone maker’s App Store was unlawful. The move came after the games maker sought to offer in-app purchases without using Apple’s digital payments service. The complaint, alongside a similar one against Alphabet Inc.’s Google, was made public by the Competition Appeal Tribunal Thursday.Apple has abused its “dominant position,” Epic said, according to the filing. “This is an important argument to make on behalf of consumers and developers in the U.K. and around the world who are impacted by Apple and Google’s misuse of market power,” Epic said in a follow-up statement. “Epic is not seeking damages from Apple or Google in the U.K., Australia or the U.S., it is simply seeking fair access and competition that will benefit all consumers.” Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.This is the latest step by the company to get Apple to reinstate the battle royale video game in the British App Store. Epic offered a payment system that circumvented the App Store, meaning Apple didn’t get a cut.Read more about this legal fight here.
