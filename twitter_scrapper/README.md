# Scripts for Twitter scraping
Both of these scripts can at least obtain the datetime and the content of tweets.

## Note: 
* Both of these scripts work fine, but couldn't figure out how to get the additional information like RTcount and other values.
* sns_collect2.pyy seems like a better approach due to easy access to tweet information types, but variables like retweetcount don't seem to be recognized...
